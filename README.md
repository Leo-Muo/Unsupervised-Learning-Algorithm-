# Unsupervised-Learning-Algorithm-

Created a crop recommendation system using the unsupervised learning algorithm Gaussian Mixture Model, Silhouette coefficients for cluster validation, and Inertia, a metric that indicates how successfully an algorithm clusters a dataset. All these were programmed using Python on Google Colab.
